# Supermarket-Website-using-php-html-css-project-
In this project, I created a Walmart-type Supermarket's  dynamic web applications website using PHP, HTML, and CSS. My website interacts with MySQL, as PHP has strong integration capabilities with various databases I used to interact with databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.
For the client, the website collects various information like name, age, gender, phone no, and the feedback of the store from the customer and stores it in the database table. Which can be later used for data analysis to retrieve various 
future predictions.
