# Supermarket-Website-using-php-html-css-project-
In this project I created a Walmart type Supermarket  dynamic web applications website using php,html,css.My website interacts with MySQL,as php has strong integration capabilities with various databases I usedphp to interact with databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.
For the client the website collects various informations like name,age,gender,phone no and the feedback of the store from the customer and stores it in the database table. Which can be later used for data analysis to retrive various 
future predictions.
